Our fashion AI assistant, powered by GenAI, addresses this challenge by generating tailored outfit recommendations based on user preferences, style inputs, and event contexts. By utilizing GenAI, we ensure the assistant can intelligently synthesize fashionable ensembles that blend individual tastes with current fashion trends. This project aims to streamline and elevate the outfit selection process, helping users feel more confident and stylish in their clothing choices. Through the integration of GAN-based AI, we envision empowering people with personalized fashion guidance, ultimately impacting their self-expression and enhancing their everyday lives.
